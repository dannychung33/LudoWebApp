    Rules
  </div>
  <div class="payload">
    <strong>A turn</strong></br>
    Players take turns in a clockwise order; highest throw of the die starts. <br />
    Each throw, the player decides which piece to move. A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track
    given by the number thrown. If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next
    player. <br />
    A throw of 6 gives another turn. <br />
    A player must throw a 6 to move a piece from the starting circle onto the first square on the track. The piece moves
    6 squares around the circuit beginning with the appropriately coloured start square (and the player then has another
    turn). <br />
    If a piece lands on a piece of a different colour, the piece jumped upon is returned to its starting circle. <br />
    If a piece lands upon a piece of the same colour, this forms a block. This block cannot be passed or landed on by
    any opposing piece. <br />
    <strong>Winning</strong> <br />
    When a piece has circumnavigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home
    triangle by an exact throw. <br />
    The first person to move all 4 pieces into the home triangle wins.
