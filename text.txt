User
	- Player
	- Bot
Game piece:
  - Color
  - status(bool), = true: completed, false: not completed
  - position from home: how many spots have i moved
  - current_global_spot: uniquely identify position of coin on board
  - direction
 // - move method : move left / move right

//NOTE: whenever you move a coin, update the position from home and current_global_spot
//User[] users
//each user has an array of pieces
//every piece has a current_global_spot
//loop through the array of users, for every user, loop through pieces, check their global_ids, if any of their global ids match with
//your current global id, send that piece of that user back to home ;) ~ with the exception of your piece :)
//if there are multiple pieces of another user in the same spot as you're gonna land, then you miss your chance [sorry :(]
//if you land in the same spot as another one of your own pieces, the size of each of these pieces, halves

/** ABOUT WINNING **/
so if you have a piece that lands in the home spot, you place it in its completed tray, and status changes to true
 => create a completed tray for each house on the canvas
 => remove one die

/ ** MOVING PIECES **/
we have an onClick for each of the coins, that when the user clicks on a piece, it becomes "active" (status: true)
alos, when the user hovers on a piece, it lights up a bit to show that it is movable (onMouseOver/onHover)

so basically, whenever a user has multiple pieces out, the one that they tap on, movement gets applied to it

if the user does not have any pieces out yet, they cannot move until they first get a 6 on the die
~ could show a little note that "no possible moves yet. get a 6 first mate :)"

/ ** WHOSE TURN IT IS **/
the die becomes the color of the house/user who's turn it is,
we will also have a text box that shows who's turn it is

 -- order of turns is typically: green, red, blue, yellow


/** END CONDITION **/

/** BOT CHOICE **/
priority list:
	op1. Get a piece out
  op2. for a piece get to landing square
  op3. kill
  op4. get into the safe zone
  op5. move into a square where u have another piece in
  op6. move away from an enemy that is 6 or less distance behind you
  op7. move away from an enemy if ur roll gets u to at least 6 position away
  Priya: op7, op6, op1, op3, op4, op5, op2
  Jenna: op7, op1, op4, op5, op2, op3, op6
  Danny:
// if bot didn’t roll 6, all pieces that’s outside is the choice are all u choices, if the bot can kill,
// if u rolled 6 , all pieces that outside and the piece at home are all u choices



Methods for user:
  (bool)completedTheGame:true/false

  generate Choices(){

  }
  after move:
  check if theres collision:
    if collide with opponent:....
    if collide with self: nothing happens square is blocked: opponent cannot go on there, if opponent will land on the same square, he will not move.
  when the player/bot finishes his move :
  Get status(){
    if all 4 pieces is completed game end user wins this player.gamepiece1.status == false return false
  }

Generate Choices:

// if u didn’t roll 6, all pieces that’s outside is the choice are all u choices
// if u rolled 6 , all pieces that outside and the piece at home are all u choices


// mousekeydown x in range  xxxx y in range XXX
